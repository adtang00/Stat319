# 1. Dataset Overview

## Wine Quality Dataset
- Collected in 2009, reporting physiochemical properties for red and white Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wines.  
- 6497 rows, 11 columns: `fixed_acidity`, `volatile_acidity`, `citric_acid`, `residual_sugar`, `chlorides`, `free_sulfur_dioxide`, `total_sulfur_dioxide`, `density`, `ph`, `sulphates`, `alcohol`, `quality`, `color`.  
- Observational study; each wine sample measured independently.  

## Obesity Dataset
- Factors: `MTRANS` (transportation method), `CAEC` (calories/food consumption behavior).  
- Response variable: `Weight` (or obesity level score).

# 2. One-Sample T-Test: Wine Alcohol Content
**Research Question:** Is the average alcohol content of red and white wine greater than 10.5%?

**Hypotheses:**  
- \(H_0: \mu = 10.5\)  
- \(H_a: \mu > 10.5\)  

**Results:**  
- Sample mean: 10.4918  
- t-statistic: -0.5541  
- Critical t-value (α = 0.05): 1.6451  
- One-tailed p-value: 0.7102  
- 95% Confidence Interval: (10.4628, 10.5208)  

**Conclusion:** Fail to reject \(H_0\). There is insufficient evidence that the mean alcohol content exceeds 10.5%.  

---

# 3. Bootstrap Confidence Interval: Wine pH
- 95% confidence interval for wine pH: (3.215, 3.222).  
- QQ plot indicates approximate normality.  

**Conclusion:** We are 95% confident that the true population mean pH lies between 3.215 and 3.222.

# 4. Analysis of Variance (Obesity Dataset)

### ANOVA Model and Assumptions
- Two-way ANOVA with interaction: `Weight ~ MTRANS * CAEC`.  
- **Residual Analysis:**  
  - QQ plot shows approximate normality.  
  - Residual plot shows no clear pattern (homoscedasticity).  
- **Conclusion:** ANOVA assumptions satisfied (normality, independence, equal variance).  

### F-Tests for Factors

| Factor  | F-statistic | F-critical | p-value         | Conclusion |
|---------|------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| MTRANS  | 6.85       | 2.376      | 1.78 × 10⁻⁵    | Reject H₀: At least one group mean differs |
| CAEC    | 149.69     | 2.609      | 1.11 × 10⁻¹⁶   | Reject H₀: At least one group mean differs |

**Interpretation:** Both MTRANS and CAEC significantly affect Weight; differences between group means are unlikely due to chance.  

---

# 5. Multiple Comparisons
- Tukey HSD pairwise tests show:  
  - MTRANS: at least one pair of transportation methods differs significantly.  
  - CAEC: multiple dietary behavior levels show highly significant differences.  

---

# 6. Interaction Plot
The interaction plot indicates **non-additive effects**, supporting the inclusion of the interaction term in the ANOVA model.  

---

# 7. Summary
1. Wine alcohol content does not significantly exceed 10.5% (t-test).  
2. Wine pH bootstrap CI confirms approximate normality.  
3. Obesity dataset ANOVA shows both MTRANS and CAEC significantly affect Weight.  
4. Residual and QQ plots satisfy model assumptions.  
5. Multiple comparisons reveal which specific factor levels differ.  
6. Interaction plot confirms non-additive effects.
